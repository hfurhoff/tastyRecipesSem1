                <p>
                    The Tasty Recipes project started out as a school assignment but 
                    have grown to be one of the most visited recipe-pages on the 
                    world wide web. The key to our success was indefinitely our 
                    extraordinary calendar, where you can see what you are supposed 
                    to eat this month according to the board of health.
